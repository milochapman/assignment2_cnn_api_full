# Rubric Self-Checklist (Before Submitting)

- [x] **New code committed to GitHub**
- [x] **Docker deployment included** (`Dockerfile` or `Dockerfile.uv`)
- [x] **API successfully callable** (`/predict` returns class + probability)
- [x] **Code is well organized** (`helper_lib/`, `app/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`)
- [x] **Theory questions answered correctly** (see `THEORY.md`)

**Recommended**: Commit `uv.lock` (after `uv lock`) and include `weights/cnn_cifar10.pt` so graders can run inference immediately.
